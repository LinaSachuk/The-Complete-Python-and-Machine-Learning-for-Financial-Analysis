# “The Complete Python and Machine Learning for Financial Analysis” course in which you will learn everything you need to develop practical real-world finance/banking applications in Python!

1. The course is divided into 3 main parts covering python programming fundamentals, financial analysis in Python and AI/ML application in Finance/Banking Industry. A detailed overview is shown below:

a) Part #1 – Python Programming Fundamentals: Beginner’s Python programming fundamentals covering concepts such as: data types, variables assignments, loops, conditional statements, functions, and Files operations. In addition, this section will cover key Python libraries for data science such as Numpy and Pandas. Furthermore, this section covers data visualization tools such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Bokeh.

b) Part #2 – Financial Analysis in Python: This part covers Python for financial analysis. We will cover key financial concepts such as calculating daily portfolio returns, risk and Sharpe ratio. In addition, we will cover Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), Markowitz portfolio optimization, and efficient frontier. We will also cover trading strategies such as momentum-based and moving average trading.

c) Part #3 – AI/Ml in Finance/Banking: This section covers practical projects on AI/ML applications in Finance. We will cover application of Deep Neural Networks such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks to perform stock price predictions. In addition, we will cover unsupervised machine learning strategies such as K-Means Clustering and Principal Components Analysis to perform Baking Customer Segmentation or Clustering. Furthermore, we will cover the basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and apply it to perform stocks sentiment analysis.
